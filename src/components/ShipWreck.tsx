// A sunken ship, half-buried in the seabed -- background scenery for the
// Kraken's lair (level 11), the reward for playing 11 games in a row.
// Positioned in scene-absolute coordinates (not around an origin like the
// predators/Puffer, since it never moves or scales). The whole group is
// nudged down 9 units from where its paths were originally drawn --
// without it, the hull's bottom edge sat a few units above the sand's own
// curve (BattleScene.tsx's wavy sand `<path>`, which dips and rises with
// x), leaving a sliver of visible water between hull and seabed instead
// of actually resting on it. No longer dimmed with a group-wide opacity
// either (it used to render at 0.85) -- that read as translucent/ghostly
// rather than "sunken", which wasn't the intent; the individual plank-
// shading/rudder-crack details still carry their own small opacities.
