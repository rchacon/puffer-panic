// Level 11's threat -- unlike the rest of BattleScene.tsx's shallow-lake
// scene (see AGENTS.md), this one approaches the puffer the same plain
// linear way every other predator does, no custom `PREDATOR_APPROACH`
// entry needed. An earlier revision kept it stationary and had it dip
// deeper into the water each round instead (see git history/AGENTS.md for
// that whole detour) -- reverted once the source art itself changed: this
// photo's neck is already curved sharply downward on its own, so the
// "leaning down for a drink" read doesn't need a custom animation to
// manufacture it, and a normal approach reads as a real threat the way a
// stationary one didn't.
//
// User-provided raster art (not vendored/licensed, see AGENTS.md), real
// alpha already (no flood-fill fake-transparency trap), cropped to
// content, downscaled to 700px wide, palette-quantized (checked for
// banding on the throat/neck shading; none).
//
// The nose tip sits at roughly (15, 695) in the saved 700x816 file --
// found via the usual coordinate-grid overlay technique. At this
// component's own display scale (200/700), that's (4, 199), hence the
// <image>'s x/y below: the nose lands at local (0, 0), the same shared
// reference point every other predator's mouth lands on at the closest
// approach.
